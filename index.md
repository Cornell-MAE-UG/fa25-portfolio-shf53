## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Senior at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering while pursuing a Business minor, with plans to pursue a Master of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering. Born and raised in Long Island, New York, I’ve developed a wide range of interests and passions , with music being one of the most significant. I enjoy singing and playing the guitar, drums, saxophone, and oboe. Outside of music, I enjoy surfing, biking, staying active, and exploring my interests in film, history, and technology. My areas of interest in engineering are in Aerospace, Propulsion, Robotics, Additive Manufacturing, and Music Synthesis.

Being an engineering student at Cornell has allowed me to connect these passions in meaningful ways. As Team Lead of the Cornell Mars Rover Project, I apply my technical and leadership skills to real-world engineering challenges, while also pursuing my musical side through the Cornell Jazz Ensembles and an independent rock band. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and collaboration, and I look forward to discovering new opportunities to grow and make an impact.
