#### Projects
- **Boeing 737 Max Ethical Analysis**:  
  *A case study examining how engineering, management, and regulatory failures surrounding the Boeing 737 Max led to catastrophic consequences, emphasizing the ethical responsibility of engineers to prioritize safety and ethical standards over profit and schedule pressures.*  
  - Identified how communication breakdowns between engineers, executives, and regulators contributed to ethical and technical failures in the MCAS system. 
  - Highlighted the importance of stakeholder accountability, showing how ethical decision-making and transparency among engineers, management, pilots, regulators, and the public are essential to prevent future engineering disasters.

- **Wind Turbine Blade Design and Analysis**:  
  *Designed and tested miniature wind turbine blades to optimize aerodynamic efficiency within structural and geometric constraints using QBlade simulations, MATLAB modeling, and experimental validation in Cornell’s Big-Blue wind tunnel.*  
  - Designed and analyzed a NACA 4412-based blade optimized for mid-range tip-speed ratios and sub-2000 RPM operation  
  - Conducted wind-tunnel power extraction tests, comparing modeled and measured performance to assess aerodynamic efficiency and discrepencies
